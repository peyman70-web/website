            An escape room is a game where players must work together to uncover clues, solve puzzles, and complete tasks in one or more rooms with the objective of completing a specified goal in a restricted period of time
            , and the main goal is simpleâ€¦ ESCAPE!

You can have real-life escape rooms as well as online escape rooms. Online escape rooms are also known as virtual escape rooms.
 Typically, the objective of an escape room is to get out of the room before the time limit expires. There are many different types of escape games available here at Escape Live!
Why do an Escape Room?
Escape rooms provide a lot of benefits. A few reasons why individuals participate in escape rooms include the following:

Escape Rooms are fun
Escape rooms are simply fun, they provide a lot of enjoyment and are an excellent way to spend your free time with friends and family.
 When participating in escape rooms, one is compelled to solve riddles and think outside the box so you can feel a sense of accomplishment alongside having a fun time.

Live out your fantasy
In an escape room, you can be transported to an entirely different world. You can be a detective or a spy saving the world, or a whole variety of different roles in the various themed rooms.
 Most escape rooms have some kind of story behind them, an adventure for you to explore whilst escaping. Which makes them a lot of fun!

An hour away from the world
You get to spend an hour away from the world solving the escape room experience, and that is priceless. Being able to just be somewhere else for an hour of your day can help take some stress away from your normal day.
